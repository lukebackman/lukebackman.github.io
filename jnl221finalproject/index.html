					<p>As crime seems to be everywhere and at any given point nowadays, people have begun to question whether it has always been this bad or is this something that is new. As 2023 came around it didn’t take long to see that these crimes were nothing new. Especially in the city of Syracuse where in the course of four months close to 3,000 crimes were committed. As the nation continues to look to put a stop to all of this, can we find any pattern from our city? </p>

					<p>While homicides continued to rise across the country, the city of Syracuse proved to be an exception in the year 2022. In fact homicides decreased by 3% last year. Now people in the city would like to see that turn into a trend that continues and buck the pattern seen in the country. Well if there was any good news to come out of the first four months of crime in the city, it would favor the people hoping to slow the trend in the city. </p>

					<p>Seeing that the city of Syracuse had 18 homicides last year, looking at the data will show that in these four months of the new year there have only been four murders in the city. Showing that the city is on pace to lower the number of murders once again. Along with the decreasing pace, a positive note in the saddest of circumstances is that all four of these murders did in fact lead to arrests. But while people rejoice in seeing a decrease in homicides, this has left the door open for other crimes such as robbery and assaults to have increased.</p>
				</div>

		
	<div class= "container">

			<div class= "row">

				<div class="col-sm">

				<p>Robbery during this time has been seen 69 times in the city, but what is both shocking and concerning is the amount of assaults that took place. In a time span of only a couple weeks assaults had skyrocketed in the city of Syracuse. A total of 916 assaults have occurred since the turn of the new year.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>


<div class= "container">

			<div class= "row">

				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>Assaults are categorized with two different names, one being simple assault and the other one being the more violent type named aggravated assaults. In the grand total there were 692 simple assaults compared to the 224 aggravated assaults that have taken place.</p>
			</div>
				

<div class= "container">

			<div class= "row">

				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>As murders in particular have risen throughout the country, these violent crimes have also seen an uptick. What’s to make of all this and why has Syracuse seen an rise in certain components of these violent crimes, but in other spots a decrease?</p>
					</div>
				</div>

<div class= "container">

			<div class= "row">

				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>Currently it's hard to see reasoning as to why this is happening as “excuses that have been said in the past now aren’t applicable. This is referring to the year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many people, both politicians and everyday citizens had placed a lot of the blame on the pandemic as a reason for the unrest seen widespread throughout the country. This wasn’t an excuse for the violence and crime, but was reasoning that was put out to try and have people understand what was happening all around.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

<div class= "container">

			<div class= "row">

	<div class="col-sm">
					<p>But this doesn’t mean that Syracuse police aren't aware of what is happening and how horrendous these crimes are and can be. In fact when looking at the crimes committed they use a measurement to determine the ‘quality of life’. Meaning that these crimes can affect residents' way and obviously quality of life. In 2023 there had been 283 crimes labeled in the quality of life category as “true.’ Meaning that whatever crime occurred could have had a more serious impact with the chance of a potential life being lost. So the police understand how important and now how frequently these violent crimes are occuring. </p>

<iframe title="Crimes that affect citizens quality of life" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-RK3aH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RK3aH/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 300px;!important; border: none;" height="100" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

			</div>
			
 <div class="col-sm">


					<p>While violent crimes have gone up 12% in different cities across the country it has become clear that this is something that has seriously affected the city of Syracuse as well.</p>

					</div>
						

					<p>But when talking to lifetime citizen and now professor at Syracuse University Dan Lyon says that he thinks that crime in his eyes is about the same as when he was growing up. In fact he says that he believes that the city is probably the “safest it’s ever been” when talking about its current state. </p>

				

<div class= "row">

				<div class="col-sm">
					
					<p>So as citizens hope that their city will continue to buck the trend of violence that the country has seen over the years by the way 2023 has started they will have some work to do. Maybe citizens in Syracuse can’t see a pattern to compare their city to the state of the country, but maybe in the end that’s a good thing.</p>
